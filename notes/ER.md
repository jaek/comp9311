# Drawing ER diagrams

The world is viewed as being made up of a collection of inter-related entities.
ER has three major modelling constructs:
* entity - collection of attributes describing an object
* attribute - data item describing a property
* relationship - association between entities

#### Entities and attributes

* Entities represent things which exist in the real world. Attributes describe
properties of entities. 
* Attributes may be single valued (atomic) or multivalued.
* An attribute may also have a NULL value.
* A derived attribute is an attribute whose value can be derived from other
attributes/entities.
* Entities usually have a key: a set of attributes which uniquely identifies an
    entity.
* Keys are indicated in ER diagrams by underlining.

# Cheatsheet

* Keys are indicated by underlining.
* Composite attributes use () - composite: attribute consists of a number of
    attributes
* Multivalued attributes use {} - multivalued: there may be any number of
    possible elements to this attribute
